# FreeRTOS Fundamentals Project

## Overview 🚀

Welcome to the FreeRTOS Fundamentals project! This small-scale project delves into the core elements of FreeRTOS, offering a hands-on exploration of key concepts. Let's dive into the fundamentals:

## Project Highlights 🧾

### Binary Semaphores 🔒

Explore the power of binary semaphores, ensuring synchronization and protection for the `Shared_Resource` variable of type `uint32_t`. Thread safety is at the heart of this project, showcasing the significance of these semaphores.

### Queue Communication 📬

Discover the seamless communication between tasks through a well-designed queue system. Tasks efficiently exchange data, illustrating the importance of inter-task communication for a cohesive system.

### Software Timer ⏰

Experience the precision of a software timer as it orchestrates periodic actions. Witness the overwrite of the `Shared_Resource` variable every 10 seconds, showcasing the versatility and reliability of software timers within the FreeRTOS framework.

### UART Communication 📡

Embark on a journey into UART communication, where real-time data is displayed through the RealTerm terminal. For this project, the STM32F401RCT6 microcontroller is utilized, with USB UART providing the communication link to RealTerm. This visual representation enhances the project's user interface, providing dynamic insights into the system's behavior.

## Usage 🛠

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up your development environment with FreeRTOS.
3. Build and flash the project to your STM32F401RCT6 target device.
4. Connect USB UART for RealTerm communication.
5. Observe the RealTerm terminal to witness the dynamic behavior of the system.
